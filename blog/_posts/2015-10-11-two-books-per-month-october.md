This month I bought **Kyle Sympson's** ["Types & Grammar"](http://www.amazon.com/You-Dont-Know-JS-Grammar/dp/1491904194) and ["Async & Performance"](http://www.amazon.com/You-Dont-Know-JS-Performance/dp/1491904224).

Now I have all the e-books and paper ones from **You Don't Know JS** series *{feeling happy}*.
