After spending some time mainly with e-books and e-readers (blaah, where was my mind!),
recently I rediscover the beauty and awesomeness of the paper. Paper books just feel good in your hands -
all the e-readers and e-devices are somehow cold and lifeless.

So, my new passion raised - **#twoBooksPerMonth**. My goal - buy all my fav tech books on paper.
This month I bought **Kyle Sympson's** ["Scope & Closures"](http://www.amazon.com/You-Dont-Know-JS-Closures/dp/1449335586/)
from You Don't Know JS series and **Nicholas C. Zakas** ["The Principles of Object-Oriented JavaScript"](http://www.amazon.com/Principles-Object-Oriented-JavaScript-Nicholas-Zakas/dp/1593275404/).
